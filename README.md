# Weather-App
## Just a regular weather app that uses ```https://openweathermap.org/``` API.
## Inspired by awesome JS tutorial by **[BroCode](```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4&t=40904s```)**.  
### Functionalities:
 - Connects with API and provides weather forecast for the 5 days (minor free plan API disadvantage) for:
     - any city by typing it in
     - city based on your IP address by clicking the pin button.

- Show additional details i.e humidity, sunrise, sunset and wind speed for selected day.

### How to make it work
1. Sign in/up into the [open weather](```https://openweathermap.org/```) and get your API key in your profile tab.
2. Download the repository.
3. Paste in your API key in the suitable field.
4. Oh man, if you don't have **Mozzilla Firefox** then better do not continue.
5. But if you do have **Firefox** , just open the .html file or create local server with suitable VS code extension.

### Why does it only work on mozzilla?
Exhaustion and excitement after making **this thing** work led me to the conclusion, that I need to move on to the other projects.
